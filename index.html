							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>About Me
								Hello! I'm Tayyar Mustamir, a computer science student at Rutgers University, born in New Brunswick, NJ, and raised in Manalapan, NJ. Growing up in Manalapan, I was always fascinated by how technology shapes our world. My passion for coding began early, and I've been dedicated to mastering the art and science of programming ever since. At Rutgers, I've been diving deep into the world of technology, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to innovate. Whether it's developing dynamic websites or crafting efficient algorithms, I love transforming ideas into reality through code. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing cricket or immersed in the latest manga. These hobbies keep me balanced and inspired, bringing fresh perspectives to my work. My mission is to leverage my skills and enthusiasm to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. I aspire to work on projects that not only push the boundaries of what's possible but also make a positive difference in people's lives. </p>

							<h2>GitHub</h2>
							<p>Explore my world of code on GitHub! As a dedicated computer science student at Rutgers University, I've filled my GitHub with a diverse array of projects, from data structures and algorithms to internet technology projects such as client-server applications and creating my own HTTP server. Each repository is a testament to my passion for coding and my drive to innovate. Dive into my latest creations, see how I tackle complex problems, and maybe even find a project to collaborate on. Let's push the boundaries of technology together!</p>
